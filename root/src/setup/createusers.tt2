  <h1>Create users</h1>
  <p>Ok! You created some accounts. As a final step, you need to create at least one user. You'll then use that user to log into MoneyTraq and register transactions. It's best that you create a user for each actual person that's going to use MoneyTraq.</p>
  <p>
    There are two types of users in MoneyTraq: administrators and regular users.
    Regular users can create and edit transactions and can request reports.
    Administrators can also edit the global settings of MoneyTraq (the settings that reflect on all users).
    You'll need at least one administrator.
  </p>
  <p>Fill out the form below and click "create user" to create a user.</p>
