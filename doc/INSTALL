INSTALL
=======

To install MoneyTraq you need a few things.

* A perl 5 installation
* An installation of Module::Install::Catalyst (cpan install Module::Install::Catalyst)
* perl Makefile.PL
* Run make to install all the modules you need to run

You also have to prepare a database in your root folder (not the folder with the name root). You have to create a SQLite database with the name MoneyTraq.db. In this database you run db/moneytraq-schema.sql.
